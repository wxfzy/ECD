# EtherNet/IP CIP Device (ECD)
EthernetIP CIP Device

**Projects Ambition**\
An API that could be used to create, configure, and interface with programmable logical controllers as an EtherNEt/IP, CIP, client device.

**Source of Idea**\
Providing the hardware needed to test code changes on large control systems can be expensive. This will provide a means of utilizing a platform such as the raspberry pi, to emulate real-world hardware.  

**Status**\
This project is currently a work in progress. When I get free time between work and family, I open up an editor and play.
